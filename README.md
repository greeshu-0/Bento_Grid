# Frontend Mentor - Bento Grid Solution

This is my solution to the **Bento Grid** layout challenge on [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/). The goal of this project is to build a **responsive bento-style grid layout** that adapts smoothly across various screen sizes, while following best practices in HTML, CSS, and responsive design.
